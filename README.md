## Blockchain NodeJS
This repository is for the backend of my project which will be using blockchain to store votes from an online voting application hosted on Google Firebase.
<b>Still a work in progress</b>
## Motivation
For my final year project in college we were asked to create a project based around emerging technologies. I choose blockchain for my emerging technology. Looking and understanding about blockchain was difficult to understand so I decided to create my own in order to undertstand the conecpets behind the blockchain. I am using an ExpressJS server to run 'miner nodes' that will add blocks to their blockchain and update other connected 'peers'.
